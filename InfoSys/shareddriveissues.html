            &emsp;&emsp; When was the last time they were able to access the drive without an issue or error? <br>
            o&emsp;&emsp;This way, you will be able to identify if they have an access to the drive. <br>
            o&emsp;&emsp;If they are accessing the drive for the 1st time, ask for the request number and check the status <br>
            &emsp;&emsp; of the ticket, if they don’t have one, provide the catalog title from our SD Guide and refer them to <br>
            &emsp;&emsp; pITstop. <br>
            &emsp;&emsp; Exact error message and full path of the drive <br>
            o&emsp;&emsp;This will enable you to easily identify the issue and troubleshoot appropriately and effectively <br>
            o&emsp;&emsp;If they do not have the path, you can ask the user to ask their colleague (who is currently <br>
            &emsp;&emsp; mapped to the drive and can access it) for a copy of the path so you can easily map the drive for the <br>
            &emsp;&emsp; user. <br> <br>

                Note: Access to the folder doesn’t guarantee access to the entire drive or access the contents of a <br>
                specific folder, it is important to educate the user about type of access in submitting Network Folder Access. <br>
